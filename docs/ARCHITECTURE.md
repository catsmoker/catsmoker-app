# Architecture

A high-level map of the CatSmoker Android codebase and how the layers fit together.

## Module layout

Single application module under `app/` with `distribution` product flavors
(`full`, `playstore`) — see [`FLAVOR_WORKFLOW.md`](FLAVOR_WORKFLOW.md). There
is no separate `core`/`feature` Gradle split and no separate Git branch;
features are separated by Kotlin packages, variants by source set:

```
app/src/
├── main/                   # shared code — ships in BOTH variants
│   └── java/com/catsmoker/app/
│       ├── system/         # entry, DI, shell, navigation, ads call points
│       │   ├── navigation/ # Routes + AppNavHost (+ variant spoofGraph())
│       │   ├── shell/ShellRunner.kt  # root + Shizuku command execution
│       │   └── ads/        # ( Implementations live per-flavor; see below)
│       ├── shared/         # data/models, ui/theme, components
│       └── features/       # main, gamingtools, editgamefiles, permissions,
│                           # logs, settings, about (+ legal screens)
├── full/                   # Full/GitHub-only: spoofdevice/ (+ root/ LSPosed,
│                           # Magisk builder), SpoofRepository et al, Start.io
│                           # AdManager/AdBanner/AdsInit, SelfUpdater, scope
│                           # array, xposed_init, spoof manifest entries
├── playstore/              # Play-only: AdMob AdManager/AdBanner/AdsInit,
│                           # no-op variant shims, AdMob App ID manifest entry
└── testFull/               # full-only unit tests (src/test/ runs on both)
```

Variant seams are same-FQN pairs (`VariantCapabilities`, `AdsInit`,
`AdManager`, `AdBanner`, `spoofGraph()`, `ProfileShareHandler`,
`SelfUpdater`): `src/main` never imports `src/full`, so the Play compile
cannot see the restricted implementations at all.

## Dependency direction

Higher-level feature screens depend on the `system` and `shared` layers,
not the other way around:

```
features/*  ──►  system/*  ──►  shared/*
            └──────────┬──────────┘
                       ▼
              Android framework + 3rd-party SDKs
```

Pure-Kotlin logic (parsers, template builders, models) has no Android
imports and is unit-tested under `app/src/test` (both variants) plus
`app/src/testFull` (Full-only: spoof/LSPosed/Magisk).

## Key components

### `ShellRunner` (`system/shell/ShellRunner.kt`)
The single choke point for privileged work. It routes a command through
whatever channel is available — `su` (libsu), the Shizuku binder, or a
plain `/system/bin/sh` — and caches which channel works. Everything else
calls `exec`/`execSafe` rather than spawning processes itself.

### `CatsmokerApp` + `MainActivity`
Application entry point and Compose host. A Hilt module provides
`ShellRunner`, the engines and repositories used across screens.

### Engines
- `MetricsEngine` — telemetry/overlay data (see `METRICS_ENGINE.md`).
- `GamingEngine` — Gaming Mode + booster services (see `GAMING_MODE.md`).

### Overlay & background services
Several long-running `Service` implementations live under
`gamingtools/tools/` (crosshair, performance overlay, auto force-stop,
VPN firewall, app booster). Each reads/writes shared prefs and StateFlows
so the Compose UI and the overlay stay in sync.

## Concurrency model

- Every engine exposes `MutableStateFlow`/`StateFlow` so Compose can
  collect it, and keeps a `CoroutineScope(SupervisorJob() + Dispatchers.IO)`.
- Shell work is always launched on a background dispatcher and funneled
  through `ShellRunner`.
- Long-running sweeps (e.g. ART dexopt) guard against re-entrancy with
  `AtomicBoolean` flags and check a cancellation flag between items, so a
  stop always lands cleanly.
- Shared prefs are the persistence layer for "is Gaming Mode active",
  user game library, spoof profiles, etc. State is restored on restart.

## Persistence

- `SharedPreferences` — feature state, user game library, spoof profile
  assignments, Gaming Mode snapshots.
- Game files — read/written through SAF, Shizuku or manual export.
- Spoof profiles — JSON (Gson) with device presets.
